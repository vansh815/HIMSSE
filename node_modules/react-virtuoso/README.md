[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-virtuoso.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-virtuoso)

**React Virtuoso** is a simple, easy to use React virtualized list component that can render huge data sets.
Out of the box, Virtuoso:

- Handles items with **variable dynamic height**; no manual measurements or hard-coding of item heights necessary;
- Supports **grouping with sticky group headers** (`GroupedVirtuoso`);
- Supports **responsive grid layout** (`VirtuosoGrid`);
- Automatically handles content resizing;
- Can render header at the top of the list;
- Can render footer at the end of the list;
- Can **pin the first `N` items** to the top of the list.

For live examples and documentation, check the [website](//virtuoso.dev).

## Get Started

Install the package in your React project:

```sh
npm install react-virtuoso
```

Or, if yarn is your thing:

```sh
yarn add react-virtuoso
```

Then, put the component somewhere in your tree:

```jsx
import * as React from 'react'
import * as ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import { Virtuoso } from 'react-virtuoso'

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Virtuoso style={{ width: '200px', height: '400px' }} totalCount={200} item={index => <div>Item {index}</div>} />
  )
}

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'))
```

### Grouping

The `GroupedVirtuoso` component is similar to the "flat" `Virtuoso`, with the following differences:

- Instead of `totalCount`, the component accepts `groupCounts: number[]`, which specifies the amount of items in each group.
  For example, passing `[20, 30]` will render two groups with 20 and 30 items each;
- In addition the `item` render prop, the component requires an additional `group` render prop,
  which renders the **group header**. The `group` callback receives the zero-based group index as a parameter;
- The `item` render prop gets called with an additional second parameter, `groupIndex: number`.

Check the
[grouped numbers](https://virtuoso.dev/grouped-numbers),
[grouped by first letter](https://virtuoso.dev/grouped-by-first-letter) and
[groups with load on demand](https://virtuoso.dev/grouped-with-load-on-demand)
examples.

### Grid

The `VirtuosoGrid` component displays **same sized items** in multiple columns.
The layout and item sizing is controlled through CSS class properties, which allows you to use media queries, min-width, percentage, etc.

Check the [responsive grid columns](https://virtuoso.dev/grid-responsive-columns) example for a sample implementation.

### Header

The component accepts an optional
`header` [render property](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html),
which is rendered before all items.
The header can be used to host an indicator that the user has reached the top of the list when using it bottom up.

### Footer

The component accepts an optional
`footer` [render property](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html),
which is rendered after all items.
The footer can be used to host a "load more" button
or an indicator that the user has reached the end of the list.

Check the [footer](https://virtuoso.dev/footer), [press load more](https://virtuoso.dev/press-to-load-more) and [endless scrolling](https://virtuoso.dev/endless-scrolling) examples for practical applications of the footer.

### Pinned Items

The component accepts an optional `topItems` property, that specifies
how many of the items to keep "pinned" at the top of the list. Check the [top items](https://virtuoso.dev/top-items) example.
